## README

Including the source of your data (that is, where you got the data from)
is important.

## Proposal

The template for the file was unchanged. Did you miss this part or
forget to push?

## Presentation

Your title should say something about your presentation, such as “Body
mass and flippers among palmer penguins”

The presentation title should inform the reader of the general contents
of the project.
