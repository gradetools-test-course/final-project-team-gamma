## README

The summary section of the README should introduce the project and its
relavance, outline the methods, and summarize important results.

You did not mention where you took your data from.

## Proposal

The template for the file was unchanged. Did you miss this part or
forget to push?

## Presentation

For example your title could be: “Palmer penguins: association between
body mass and flipper length”

The presentation title should inform the reader of the general contents
of the project.
