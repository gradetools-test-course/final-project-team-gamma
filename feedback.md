## README

You should provide the source of your data so that people could find the
data you used.

## Proposal

The template for the file was unchanged. Did you miss this part or
forget to push?

## Presentation

Next time use an informative title, such as “all about palmer penguins’
body mass and flipper length”

The presentation title should inform the reader of the general contents
of the project.
